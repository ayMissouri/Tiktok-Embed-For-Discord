# Tiktok-Embed-For-Discord

### What is this?
This is a trigger event for your existing discord bot that will take any TikTok videos posted in any channel that the bot can see and turn them into videos that are watchable on Discord.

### Why?
The reason I have made this is because in the current state of TikTok embeds within Discord it just posts the video as a picture so you have to go into the TikTok app to view it which is just very annoying.

### Features
Not only does this repost the video from the TikTok link, it also gets rid of those pesky TikTok watermarks that are posted all over the videos and at the end of the videos. It also allows the user to click the link that the bot posts for easy download of the video.

### Prerequisites

- A pre-existing discord bot
- API key from [here](https://rapidapi.com/yi005/api/tiktok-video-no-watermark2 "Here")


### Todo?
These are not 100% but just some things I may consider adding into the code.
- Support for Twitter videos
- Support for Instagram videos
